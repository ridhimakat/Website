  Hi, I’m Ridhima!
  Art has always been a big part of my life. Since I was young, I’ve loved experimenting with all kinds of mediums,acrylic, watercolor, pastel, etc. Even though I didn’t choose to pursue art as a career, it’s always been a passion of mine.
  What really stuck with me over the years was graphic design. I’ve been especially drawn to the geometry and structure behind good design, which I explored through classes in highschool and community college. I even did a bit of freelance work during high school, which gave me the chance to create for others.
  While I don’t consider myself a photographer, I do love capturing moments, so I’ve included some photos here that bring me joy. I also really enjoy organizing my thoughts and ideas visually, my collages and designs are a reflection of that process. This site is just a small collection of the things I’ve made and love.
  Hope you enjoy looking around!
